# Snagboot

Snagboot intends to be an open-source and generic replacement to the
vendor-specific, sometimes proprietary, tools used to recover and/or reflash
embedded platforms. Examples of such tools include STM32CubeProgrammer, SAM-BA
ISP, UUU, and sunxi-fel. Snagboot is made of three separate parts:

- **snagrecover** uses vendor-specific ROM code mechanisms to initialize
  external RAM and run U-Boot, without modifying any non-volatile
  memories.
- **snagflash** communicates with U-Boot to flash system images to non-volatile
  memories, using either DFU, UMS or Fastboot.
- **snagfactory** FIXME
