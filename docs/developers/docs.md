# Supporting new SoCs: Documenting your new support

Once your new SoC support is fully functional, the last step is to document it
in the same way as the existing SoC supports.

Update the [README](../../README.md) to mention that your SoC family is supported.

Add a section for your SoC family in:

[Setting up your device for recovery](../snagrecover.md/#setting-up-your-device-for-recovery).

and in:

[Preparing recovery firmware](../snagrecover.md/#preparing-recovery-firmware).

If there are any quirks and pitfalls that users should watch out for when
recovering your SoCs, you can mention them in
[troubleshooting.md](../troubleshooting.md).
