# Running snagflash

**Note:** A delay might be required between snagrecover and snagflash, to let
U-Boot start up before connecting to it. If Snagflash is run too early, it will
retry a few times before failing.

Snagflash always requires the "protocol" argument.

 * `-P, --protocol {dfu,ums,fastboot}`
   The protocol to use for flashing

When running snagflash right after snagrecover e.g. in an automated procedure,
make sure that U-Boot will expose the DFU/Fastboot/UMS device by the time
snagflash runs. You might want to configure your recovery U-Boot so that it
autoruns the relevant command. In case snagflash doesn't find the USB port/UMS
device it is looking for, it will retry a few times then fail.

**Warning:** Since the vid:pid pairs of U-Boot USB gadgets can vary wildly, they
are not hardcoded in snagflash. Therefore, you will not necessary have access
rights to these devices. Assuming that your U-Boot config has
`CONFIG_USB_GADGET_VENDOR_NUM=vid` and `CONFIG_USB_GADGET_PRODUCT_NUM=pid`, you
can add the following udev rule to get access:

`SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="vid", ATTRS{idProduct}=="pid", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"`

Alternatively, you can also use bus-ports addresses, which can be more stable.

## DFU mode

In DFU mode, snagflash takes additional arguments :

 * `-p --port [vid:pid | bus-port1.port2.(...)]`
   The USB address of the DFU device exposed by U-Boot
 * `-D --dfu-config  altsetting:path`
   The altsetting and path of a file to download to the board. This should match
   the value specified in dfu\_alt\_info in U-Boot. This flag can be passed
   multiple times, to specify multiple files to download.
 * `--dfu-keep`
   An optional argument to avoid detaching DFU mode after download and keep the mode active
 * `--dfu-detach`
   An optional argument to only request detaching DFU mode
 * `--dfu-reset`
   Reset USB device after download and reboot the board

Example:
```bash
# in U-Boot: setenv dfu_alt_info "mmc=uboot part 0 1"
# in U-Boot: dfu 0 mmc 0
snagflash -P dfu -p 0483:df11 -D 0:binaries/u-boot.stm32
```

For instructions on how to setup DFU in U-Boot, please refer to the [U-Boot
documentation](https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/dfu.html).

## UMS mode

Snagflash can copy a file to either a raw block device or a mounted one. When
copying to a raw block device, it uses bmap to speed up transfers.
In UMS mode, snagflash takes two mandatory arguments:

 * `-s --src filepath`
   Source file to copy to destination

Then either one of:

 * `-d --dest path`
   Sets the destination file name for transfers to mounted devices.
 * `-b â€“blockdev device`
   Sets the block device for transfers to raw block devices.

Make sure that snagflash has the necessary access rights to the target
devices/mount directories. If you are passing a raw block device, make sure that
it is not mounted.

Example:

```bash
# in U-Boot: ums 0 mmc 0
snagflash -P ums -s binaries/u-boot.stm32 -b /dev/sdb1
snagflash -P ums -s binaries/u-boot.stm32 -d /mnt/u-boot.stm32
```

**Note:** If you want a static block device path, you can use the following udev
rules to create symlinks when a certain VID:PID pair is detected: 
- For a parent block device: `SUBSYSTEM=="block", KERNEL!="*[0-9]",
  SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="...", ATTRS{idProduct}=="...",
  MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", SYMLINK+="myblockdev"`
- For a partition device: `SUBSYSTEM=="block", ATTR{partition}=="*",
  SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="...", ATTRS{idProduct}=="...",
  MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess", SYMLINK+="myblockdev$attr{partition}"`

## Fastboot mode

In fastboot mode, snagflash takes two additional arguments:

 * `-p --port [vid:pid | bus-port1.port2.(...)]`
   The USB address of the Fastboot device exposed by U-Boot
 * `-f --fastboot_cmd  cmd:args`
   A fastboot command to be sent to U-Boot. The following commands are supported
   by snagflash (which does not mean that they are supported by your U-Boot!) :

```
getvar:<var>
download:<filepath>
erase:<part>
flash:<part>
flash_sparse:<sparsefilepath>:<partition>
boot
continue
reboot
reboot-bootloader
powerdown
ucmd:<cmd>
acmd:<cmd>
oem-run:<cmd>
oem-format
oem-partconf:<args>
oem-bootbus:<args>
```

Example:
```bash
# in U-Boot: fastboot usb 0
snagflash -P fastboot -p 0483:0afb -f download:boot.img -f flash:0:1 -f boot
```

The ``flash_sparse`` command will download and flash a android sparse file with
fastboot protocol. For details about the file format, see the [sparse file format
partial documentation](developers/android-sparse-file.md).

For more information on Fastboot commands, see the [fastboot
specification](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/heads/master/fastboot/README.md)
and the [U-Boot
docs](https://elixir.bootlin.com/u-boot/v2023.04/source/doc/android/fastboot.rst).

### Extended Fastboot mode for U-Boot

This mode provides a set of enhanced Fastboot commands which leverage
U-Boot-specific functionalities to perform various flashing tasks. Interactive
commands can be passed to a CLI prompt with the "-i" flag, and can also be read
from a file using the "-I" option. Lines starting with "#" are interpreted as
comments.

Extended Fastboot mode flashing commands handle writing files larger than the
Fastboot memory buffer by slicing them up into sections. They also support bmap
sparse files and GPT table formatting.

The following set of commands are available:

```
help_text = """snagflash extended Fastboot mode
syntax: <cmd> <arg1> <arg2> ...
commands:

exit : exit snagflash
quit : exit snagflash
help : show this help text

set <var> <value>: set the value of an environment variable
print <var>: print the value of an environment variable

run <fastboot_cmd>: run a Fastboot command given in Snagflash format

gpt <partitions>: write a GPT partition table to the specified mmc device

flash <image_path> <image_offset> [<partition_name>]
	Write the file at <image_path> to an MTD device or partition.
	Required environment variables:
		- target
		- fb-addr
		- eraseblk-size (only for MTD targets)

	Optional environment variables:
		- fb-size

	If a file named "<image_path>.bmap" exists, snagflash will automatically
	parse it and flash only the block ranges described.
	partition_name: the name of a GPT or MTD partition, or a hardware partition specified
	by "hwpart <number>"

Environment variables:

target: target device for flashing commands
	must be an mmc or mtd device identifier
	e.g. mmc0, mmc1, etc. or spi-nand0, nand0, etc.

fb-addr: address in memory of the Fastboot buffer

eraseblk-size: size in bytes of an erase block on the target Flash device

fb-size: size in bytes of the Fastboot buffer, this can only be used to reduce
         the U-Boot Fastboot buffer size, not increase it.

```
